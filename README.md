### Projects
Classification Model using Sparse Neural Network
* Trained a number of models for image classification through implementation of Sparse Neural Network.
* Successfully optimized the original training performance of the Sparse models by 50% by applying weight sharing techniques.
* Produced a respectable result with an accuracy of 72%.

Song Recommendation Engine
* Led a team of 2 students, to create a song recommendation engine by implementing Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering concepts.
* Successfully deployed the recommendation system through flask applications and hosting it through Heroku.

Prediction Model for Health Care
* Trained models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNeighbors Classifier to predict heart disease in patients through medical data.
* Optimised the performance of the models through the implementation of Random Search Cross-Validation with an accuracy of 83%.
* Further analysis, representation and comparision of the models was done through SHAP.
